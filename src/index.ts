/**
 * Lightweight EventEmitter implementation for TypeScript.
 *
 * This module exposes a small, type-safe event emitter that supports
 * standard subscriptions (`on`), one-time listeners (`once`), awaiting
 * an event (`wait`), emitting (`emit`), and full cleanup (`destroy`).
 *
 * Features:
 * - `on` to register persistent listeners
 * - `once` to register one-time listeners that auto-remove after firing
 * - `emit` to invoke all listeners for a given event key
 * - `wait` to asynchronously await the next occurrence of an event (with optional timeout)
 * - `destroy` to reject pending `wait()` promises, clear timers, and remove listeners
 *
 * Notes on types and behavior:
 * - `EventsMap` maps event keys to their payload types. For events with no payload use `void` or `undefined`.
 * - `emit` expects a payload matching the event's type.
 * - `wait` resolves with the emitted payload or rejects with the string "Event timed out" (on timeout) or "EventEmitter destroyed" (when destroyed).
 *
 * @template EventsMap The mapping of event keys to payload types.
